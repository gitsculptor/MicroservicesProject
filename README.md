Overview

This project involves the development of two .NET applications using MongoDB as the database, RabbitMQ as the message broker, and gRPC for inter-application communication. The applications are containerized with Docker and can be deployed on Kubernetes. A load balancer directs traffic to the respective APIs of each application.
